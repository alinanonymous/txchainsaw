        \u001b[HIt is Autumn of 1972.
        Tragedy strikes 19 year old Rose Taylor on a drive home with her boyfriend,
        22 year old Johnny Sawyer. After being abandoned at a gas station by her
        false lover, a relaxing night on the town would become a nightmare that was
        all too real.
            The worst things she could have imagined do not compare to the horrors
        she would experience during the events of this night and the subsequent days.
        The case of Rose Taylor's misfortunate suffering and anguish would be
        documented as yet another story of the bizarre crimes that were part of:

        You, the player, are Rose Taylor. Your boyfriend, Johnny Sawyer, was 
        unfortunately from a family of cannibalistic serial murderers. He has left you 
        in the basement of the Sawyer estate, unconscious. You do not know what 
        this house has in store for you, but you know you must escape some way. 
        Will you survive? What will be left of you?


        The house is made of an almost labyrinthine series of rooms. 
        You may type the following commands to move:
        
        \u001b[38;5;196mn\u001b[0m or \u001b[38;5;196mnorth\u001b[0m to move north
        \u001b[38;5;196ms\u001b[0m or \u001b[38;5;196msouth\u001b[0m to move south
        \u001b[38;5;196me\u001b[0m or \u001b[38;5;196meast\u001b[0m to move east
        \u001b[38;5;196mw\u001b[0m or \u001b[38;5;196mwest\u001b[0m to move west
        
        There are also items and interactables around the house. The following 
        commands can be used for interaction with your environment:
        
        \u001b[38;5;196muse\u001b[0m to interact with something in your surroundings
        \u001b[38;5;196mexam\u001b[0m to examine an object closer
        \u001b[38;5;196mlook\u001b[0m to get a description of your surroundings
        \u001b[38;5;196mtake\u001b[0m to put an item in your pocket
        \u001b[38;5;196mitem\u001b[0m to use an item from your pockets
        
        Because of your injuries, you are rapidly bleeding out and must find
        time to rest and apply a bandage. Your health starts at 100 and will
        drop according to many things. Applying a bandage will increase your 
        health by 25. Beware, however, that if you don't apply a bandage within
        5 minutes, you will die.
